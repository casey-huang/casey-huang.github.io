##Beijing Land Transaction 2003-2013 Analysis

###Source:

I was curious about visualization and geocoding work people have done in China, and I stumbled upon this [Beijing City Lab](http://www.beijingcitylab.com/). The Lab aims to quantify urban dynamics and generates new insights for urban planning and governance, with a focus on the capital Beijing.

While the projects are pretty impressive, I found the cover map of [Data 2](http://www.beijingcitylab.com/data-released-1/data1-20/) could be more informative.

> - When the dots are overlapped with each other, even density is hard to tell
> - Impossible to observe trends
